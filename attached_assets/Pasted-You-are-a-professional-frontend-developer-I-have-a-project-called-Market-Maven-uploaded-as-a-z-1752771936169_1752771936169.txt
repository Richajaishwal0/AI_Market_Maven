You are a professional frontend developer. I have a project called **Market Maven** (uploaded as a zip file) that performs well functionally, but now I want to **transform its GUI into a more professional, elegant, and responsive platform**.

### OBJECTIVE:
Upgrade the **entire user interface** of the project to make it:
- Modern and professional
- Clean and visually pleasing
- Fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop)
- Suitable for real users on a production-level platform

### CURRENT STACK:
The project may be using HTML, CSS, JS, and optionally Python (Flask/Streamlit/etc). You can check and optimize accordingly.

### DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS:
1. **Use modern design principles** â€“ spacing, color palette, consistency, and clean font usage.
2. **Add a fixed header/navbar** with brand name/logo and navigation.
3. **Use card-based or section-based layout** for better content organization.
4. Integrate **charts, graphs or visuals** if the platform shows analytics or forecasts (use Chart.js or Plotly if needed).
5. Make all elements **responsive using CSS Grid or Flexbox**.
6. Add **loading animations** or transitions for a smoother feel.
7. Integrate professional UI frameworks (if needed), like:
   - Bootstrap 5 (for quick responsiveness)
   - Tailwind CSS (for clean utility-based styling)
   - Material UI (for components)

### OPTIONAL ADDITIONS:
- Add hover effects, shadows, button states (active/disabled).
- If forms are used, make them user-friendly with floating labels and validation.
- Add favicon and proper page title.
- Use Google Fonts for a sleek typography.

### OUTPUT:
Please review the existing code and refactor the GUI accordingly. Do **not break existing functionality**, just enhance the frontend appearance. If you need to add or restructure HTML/CSS/JS files, feel free to do that. Make sure everything still runs well.

Once complete, provide:
- Updated HTML/CSS/JS files
- Preview screenshots or instructions to view changes locally
